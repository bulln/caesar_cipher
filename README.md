# caesar_cipher
Project for The Odin Project - create a caesar cipher

Did this one a while back, but lost a few early projects.
Upon coming back to this one, I found map to be a good tool.
Discovered 'bytes' method which turns a string into an array of ascii characters (rather than splitting into array and using 'ord' individually).
Scratched my head for a bit looking for a formula to convert BOTH capital and lowercase characters in one go, but ended up using a case statement.
